Usage: dopewars [OPTION]...\n\
Drug dealing game based on \"Drug Wars\" by John E. Dell\n\
  -b       \"black and white\" - i.e. do not use pretty colours\n\
              (by default colours are used where the terminal supports \
them)\n\
  -n       be boring and don't connect to any available dopewars servers\n\
              (i.e. single player mode)\n\
  -a       \"antique\" dopewars - keep as closely to the original version \
as\n\
              possible (this also disables any networking)\n\
  -f file  specify a file to use as the high score table\n\
              (by default %s/dopewars.sco is used)\n\
  -o addr  specify a hostname where the server for multiplayer dopewars\n\
              can be found (in human-readable - e.g. nowhere.com - format)\n\
  -s       run in server mode (note: for a \"non-interactive\" server, \
simply\n\
              run as dopewars -s < /dev/null >> logfile & )\n\
  -S       run a \"private\" server (i.e. do not notify the metaserver)\n\
  -p       specify the network port to use (default: 7902)\n\
  -g file  specify the pathname of a dopewars configuration file. This file\n\
              is read immediately when the -g option is encountered\n\
  -r file  maintain pid file \"file\" while running the server\n\
  -c       create and run a computer player\n\
  -w       force the use of a graphical (windowed) client (GTK+ or Win32)\n\
  -t       force the use of a text-mode client (curses)\n\
              (by default, a windowed client is used when possible)\n\
  -h       display this help information\n\
  -v       output version information and exit\n\
