- Ignore "To" message field in client, and "From" field in server; use
  A_PLAYERID ability to replace player names in protocol with player IDs
- Fix GTK+ modal dialog behaviour (mouse grabbing during fighting) - _seems_
  to be OK...
- Revamp player-player fighting
- Display purchase price of drugs?
- Increase cops' toughness - they should kill a bitch in 50-70% of encounters
  (and damage should be cumulative)
- Increase difficulty of escaping from another player - impose penalty on
  running (lose drugs, free shot, destination revealed)
- Alliances/cartels - several players share cash
- Fix spying in server (currently you can spy on other players _before_ they
  accept your bitch!)
- Graphical mode server? (would avoid select() problems under Win32)
- Problems reported with display of large prices and health - "seems" to be
  OK now... (i.e. I can't see anything wrong with it!)
- Introduce minimum/maximum players options - AI players automatically
  spawned/killed to "fill the gaps" when humans leave/enter
- "Deal" option when meeting players?
- Bribe/steal bitches when meeting players (difficulty inv. prop. to number of
  bitches?)
- Fix bug with players leaving the game during fights (first, must find it)
- Metaserver keeps list of game types of each server
Cannot reproduce... can you? (- Investigate deadlock during fighting if both
                                players move to "deal")
Cannot reproduce... can you? (- Investigate prompt for bitch on every turn
                                after a spy is dispatched)
