- Fix the Encoding variable so that a) it works only on the current file
  (not on _all_ config files) and b) it only translates config file variables,
  not the defaults (which could be in a different codeset)
- Support for "proper" game dates, e.g. mm-dd-yy or dd-mm-yy
- Limit rate of server connections to combat DOS attacks / players trying
  to get a good starting day?
- Add support for reading/writing multiple configuration files to GUI client's
  Options dialog
- Startscreen
- Track down server memory corruption bug!
- Implement server option to buy more than one bitch at a time in the Pub.
- Allow customisation of GtkTextView tag colours
- Impose sensible limits on numbers in Options dialog (e.g. percentages)
  (should also enforce this for config file / server admin)
- Admin of running NT Service servers
- GSS_API SOCKS support?
- Fix problem with dialogs popping up while menus are open
- Increase difficulty of escaping from another player - impose penalty on
  running (lose drugs, free shot, destination revealed)
- Alliances/cartels - several players share cash
- Introduce minimum/maximum players options - AI players automatically
  spawned/killed to "fill the gaps" when humans leave/enter
- "Deal" option when meeting players?
- Bribe/steal bitches when meeting players (difficulty inv. prop. to number of
  bitches?)
- Problems reported with display of large prices and health - "seems" to be
  OK now... (i.e. I can't see anything wrong with it!)
- Fix GTK+ modal dialog behaviour (mouse grabbing during fighting) - _seems_
  to be OK...
- Fix bug with players leaving the game during fights (first, must find it)
- Metaserver keeps list of game types of each server
Cannot reproduce... can you? (- Investigate deadlock during fighting if both
                                players move to "deal")
Cannot reproduce... can you? (- Investigate prompt for bitch on every turn
                                after a spy is dispatched)
