<h1>Notes for developers</h1>

You are free to make whatever changes to the code you wish, as long as you
abide by the terms set out in the <a href="LICENCE">GNU General
Public License</a>. Obviously, I only have a limited amount of time to devote
to dopewars development, and so encourage discussion of the dopewars code,
documentation and concept, and particularly welcome suggested improvements.<p>

You are free to distribute modified versions of the code,
again subject to the licence, but I also welcome patches to the code at my
email address,
<a href="mailto:ben@bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk">ben@bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk</a>.
If I choose to include these patches in a new dopewars version, you will of
course be credited in the changelog (unless, of course, you don't want to
be).<p>

For information on the internal workings of the dopewars game code, and
the client-server interface, the best documentation for the budding
developer is the source code itself. I have endeavoured to add sufficient
documentation to the source where necessary; any discussion here of the
internal workings, however, may be incomplete, out of date, and possibly
misleading. Feel free to email me at the address above with questions on this;
I might possibly even know the answers!<p>
