<h1>Internationalization</h1>

dopewars uses the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/gettext/">GNU gettext</a>
utilities for internationalization (i18n) support. This allows the software
to be translated into the local language at runtime - run dopewars in the UK
and it'll talk to you in English, but run it in Germany and it'll talk to you
in German. This relies on translators to translate the program's output into
each language beforehand, of course, and so native language speakers to carry
out this task are always needed!

<h2>Running dopewars with i18n support</h2>
i18n is only included in versions of dopewars later than 1.4.8. By default,
"Native Language Support" is compiled in; binary installations should be
already set up for i18n. When compiling dopewars from source code, the
<tt>configure</tt> script should detect whether your system can support
GNU gettext. If it can, but the gettext utilities themselves are not present,
an included copy in the <tt>intl/</tt> subdirectory is used. To disable i18n,
pass the <tt>--disable-nls</tt> option to the <tt>configure</tt> script.<p>

When you run your installed copy of dopewars, it should detect your "locale"
automatically and talk to you in your native language. If this does not happen,
the following are some possible explanations:-
<ul>
<li>dopewars cannot find the locale-specific language file - by default, stored
under /usr/local/share/locale/
<li>Your language is not yet supported - why not add it yourself?
<li>Your system does not have locale support
<li>You haven't set an environment variable to specify your locale (usually
this is done automatically). For example, if you're using the <tt>bash</tt>
shell and want a German translation, the command "<tt>export LANG=de</tt>"
should fix the problem.
</ul>

<h2>Adding a new translation</h2>
Translation files are kept in the subdirectory <tt>po/</tt> of the dopewars
source code distribution. They are named by
<a href="http://userpage.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_639.html">
2-letter language codes</a> followed by the <tt>.po</tt> extension - for
example, the German translation is stored in the file <tt>po/de.po</tt>.
They are simple text files, consisting of lists of the original English string
(labelled by "msgid") followed by the translated string (labelled by
"msgstr").<p>

Adding a new translation is simply a matter of copying the reference file
<tt>dopewars.pot</tt> to your language-specific <tt>.po</tt> file in the <tt>po/</tt> directory, and filling
in the "msgstr" entries. Once this is done, edit the <tt>configure.in</tt>
file in the top dopewars directory to add your language code to the
<tt>ALL_LINGUAS</tt> variable. Then run <tt>autoconf</tt> to rebuild the
<tt>configure</tt> script, before making and installing dopewars as usual. The
new translation should now be available. Once this is complete, please
<a href="mailto:ben@bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk">send</a> the translation to be
included in the next dopewars version.<p>

Please note that some strings are <b>format strings</b> containing the %
character. These are used in the program code for substituting numbers and
other pieces of text into the string - these substitutions are are performed
using variables which are specified in the <b>same order</b> as the %
characters in the format string. For example, the following format string
substitutes in a string (%s) and an integer number (%d):-<br>
<tt>"String '%s' has %d characters"</tt><br>
The string and number are specified in order in the code. This is problematic
if your translation changes the order - for example, a valid German translation
of the string would be<br>
<tt>"%d Zeichen lang ist die Zeichenkette '%s'"</tt><br>
Now the number and string are specified in the wrong order, and this will
probably crash the program on running! To fix this, use the special notation<br>
<tt>"%2$d Zeichen lang ist die Zeichenkette '%1$s'"</tt><br>
(i.e. replace <b>%x</b> with <b>%n$x</b> where <b>n</b> is the index that the
format specifier "should" have, starting from 1.)<p>

<h2>Updating a translation for a new dopewars version</h2>
New versions of dopewars will often change what is printed to the user, and
so may may require changes to the translation. To update an existing
translation, "<tt>make</tt>" the new version of dopewars. This will create
a <tt>dopewars.pot</tt> file listing the strings that need translating. Change
into the <tt>po/</tt> subdirectory, and create a new translation file from
your "old" translation file (we'll assume it's called <tt>de.po</tt>) and
<tt>dopewars.pot</tt> with the <tt>msgmerge</tt> command:-<br>
<tt>msgmerge -o newfile de.po dopewars.pot</tt><br>
Examine this new file <tt>newfile</tt> for translations that need updating
(a search for "fuzzy" should find most of them) and then overwrite your old
translation with the new one:<br>
<tt>mv newfile de.po</tt><br>
Rebuild and reinstall dopewars, and the new translations should become
available. Again, it is deeply appreciated if such updated files are
contributed to the main dopewars distribution!<p>
