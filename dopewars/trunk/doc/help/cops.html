<ul>
<li><b>Cop</b>: A list of all cops in the game. Use the "New"
button to create a new cop, or the "Delete", "Up" and "Down" buttons
to delete the currently selected cop or to change its position in the
list. (If you delete all of the cops, then the cops will never attack
you.) Selecting a cop from this list allows the other
sections in this window to be filled in.<p /></li>

<li><b>Name</b>: The name of the cop.
<p /></li>
