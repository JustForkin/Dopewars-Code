<h1>dopewars: General Options</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>Remove drug references</b>: Do not popup random events during the game
that might mention drugs. This also disables the cops and the gun shop.
Obviously, if you really want to remove drug references completely, you
also need to change all the drug names in the
<a href="drugs.html">Drugs tab</a>.<p /></li>

<li><b>Put server in System Tray</b>: (Windows only) When running the
graphical server, and it is minimized, do not show the window in the normal
window list, but in the System Tray (the collection of small icons in the
bottom right of the screen). Clicking on the dopewars icon in the Tray will
restore the window to its normal state.<p /></li>

<li><b>Game length (turns)</b>: The number of days over which the game runs.
If this is set to 0 (zero) then the game will only end if you are killed.
<p /></li>

<li><b>Starting cash</b>: The amount of money that each player in the game
gets at the start.<p /></li>

<li><b>Starting debt</b>: The amount of money that each player in the game
starts out in debt to the Loan Shark.<p /></li>

<li><b>Currency symbol</b>: The symbol (e.g. $, &pound;, &euro;, GBP) used
to denote all prices in the game.<p /></li>

<li><b>Symbol prefixes prices</b>: If checked, then the currency symbol is
always printed <b>before</b> prices (e.g. $100). If unchecked, it follows
the prices (e.g. 100 EUR).<p /></li>

<li><b>Name of one bitch</b>: The word used to refer to a single one of your
companions. For example, you may prefer "henchman" to "bitch".<p /></li>

<li><b>Name of several bitches</b>: The word used to refer to several of your
companions. For example, you may prefer "henchmen" to "bitches".<p /></li>

<li><b>Web browser</b>: (Unix only) The full pathname of the program that you
use for displaying webpages. For example, <tt>/usr/bin/netscape</tt>.<p /></li>
</ul>
