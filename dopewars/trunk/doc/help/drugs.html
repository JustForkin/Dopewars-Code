<ul>
<li><b>Drug</b>: A list of all drugs in the game. Use the "New"
button to create a new drug, or the "Delete", "Up" and "Down" buttons
to delete the currently selected drug or to change its position in the
list. (You cannot delete all of the drugs, as this would make the
game unplayable.) Selecting a drug from this list allows the other
sections in this window to be filled in.<p /></li>

<li><b>Name</b>: The name of the drug.
<p /></li>
