<h1>Setting up and running a dopewars server</h1>

<p>Multiplayer games of dopewars require a running dopewars server; this
mediates the interactions between each player (each player runs a
<a href="clientplay.html">client</a> which connects to this server). The server
runs the game, generating drug prices and the like, and instructs the clients
accordingly. The server can be run on any machine that can be reached over
the network by clients (so you don't have to run it on the same machine that
you run your client on, for example, unless your firewall blocks the dopewars
port).</p>

<p>Single player games do not require a server (although you can still connect
to one if you like) as a "virtual server" is run by the dopewars client.</p>

<p>The dopewars server can be heavily customised by means of the
<a href="configfile.html">configuration files</a>. For example, you can
change the names of all the game locations so that the game is set in your
home city rather than New York. Any players that then connect to your
customised server will play this customised game.</p>

<h2><a name="interactive">Running an interactive server</a></h2>

<p>All the code for the dopewars server is included in the same binary as the
standard client. To run the binary in server mode, specify the <b>-s</b> or
<b>-S</b> <a href="commandline.html">command line option</a>. By default,
this runs the server in "interactive" mode; that is to say that the server
functions as normal, but in addition responds to typed commands from you.
Click <a href="servercommands.html">here</a> for a list of the valid commands
in interactive mode.</p>

<h2><a name="noninteractive">Non-interactive servers</a></h2>

<p>Usually, however, you will not need to use server commands (most can be
specified in the <a href="configfile.html">configuration files</a> anyway)
and so will want a non-interactive server. This will sit in the background
and quietly deal with dopewars games without disturbing you, the user. To
"persuade" the server to be non-interactive, you must redirect standard
input and output, and use your shell's job control to put it in the background,
with a command similar to the following:-<br>
<b>dopewars -s < /dev/null >> /var/log/dopewars.log &</b><br>
(this writes server output to the logfile <i>/var/log/dopewars.log</i>.
Alternatively you can redirect this output to <i>/dev/null</i>.)</p>

<h2><a name="metaserver">Private and public: the dopewars metaserver</a></h2>

<p>By default, a server reports its status to the dopewars
<a href="metaserver.html">metaserver</a>. It does this on startup and
shutdown, and whenever players join or leave the game. In addition, you
can force a report (under Unix systems) by sending the dopewars server
process a SIGUSR1 signal. The server will "remind" the metaserver that it
exists by ensuring that a report is sent at least once every 3 hours or so,
regardless. A "status report" comprises contact details for the server,
a count of the number of active players, and current high scores.</p>

<p>The metaserver also has a web interface, which is used by dopewars clients to
obtain the list of servers, and can also be viewed with a web browser
<a href="http://dopewars.sourceforge.net/metaserver.php?getlist=2">here</a>.</p>

<p>Whether your server connects to the metaserver can be configured with the
<a href="configfile.html#MetaServerActive">MetaServer.Active</a> configuration
file setting, or the <b>-s</b> and <b>-S</b> <a href="commandline.html">
command line options</a>.</p>

<p>N.B. Your machine may have trouble connecting with
the metaserver in some circumstances, most notably if you are using an
enforced proxy server or your DNS does not correctly resolve your IP address
to your domain name. In such cases, you may be unable to connect to the
metaserver, or it may register your server with an incorrect name. For
information on getting round these difficulties, see the
<a href="metaserver.html">metaserver</a> page.</p>
