<h1>dopewars and Microsoft Windows</h1>

dopewars now runs natively on Win32 systems (95, 98, NT, 2000). It runs by
default as a dopewars client, using the familiar Windows interface. However,
if you prefer the "original look" text mode interface, this is still
available; just right click on a shortcut to dopewars, and add <tt>-t</tt> to
the end of the command line. To run a dopewars server, add <tt>-s</tt>
instead.<p>

Binaries can be obtained from the main
<a href="http://bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~ben/dopewars/download.html">download
site</a>, or dopewars will compile with the free
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a> tools under Win32.
dopewars uses the <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GLib</a> library, which can
be obtained for Windows from <a href="http://user.sgic.fi/~tml/gimp/win32/">
http://user.sgic.fi/~tml/gimp/win32/</a>. The installation procedure is the
same as <a href="installation.html">that for Unix systems</a> - download the
tarball, extract the files, change into the created directory, run the
<b>configure</b> script, and then <b>make</b>. This builds a native Win32
binary, which does not need the Cygwin libraries to run.<p>

In virtually all respects, the Unix and Win32 versions of dopewars should be
identical. Both will accept the same command line parameters and configuration
options. However, since the standard Unix paths for the high score file and
configuration files do not translate well to Windows, by default the program
will look for both the configuration file <b>dopewars-config.txt</b> and the
high score file <b>dopewars.sco</b> in the current directory. (N.B. The 
standard Unix-like configuration files \Etc\Dopewars and $HOME\.Dopewars will
be read before dopewars-config.txt if they are present, and if you build
the program by hand, you'll need to use --datadir="." as an option to
configure in order to get this behaviour for the high score file.)<p>
