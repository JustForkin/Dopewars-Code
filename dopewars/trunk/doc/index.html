<p>dopewars is a game simulating the life of a drug dealer in 1984 New York,
based upon the MS-DOS game of the same name, in turn derived from "Drug
Wars" by John E. Dell. The aim of the game is to make lots and lots of
money, but unfortunately you start the game with a hefty debt to the loan
shark (who charges equally hefty interest) and the cops take a rather dim
view of drug dealing...</p>

<p>dopewars expands upon the MS-DOS version by introducing multiplayer
functions. With the aid of dopewars servers, several players (computer or
human) can roam New York (or some other city, chosen by the operator of the
server) and attempt to shoot other players and steal their lucrative drugs.</p>

<p>dopewars is written on the RedHat Linux platform, and should run on most
varieties of Unix, as well as under Microsoft Windows. The source code is
freely available under the <a href="LICENCE">GNU General Public License</a>.</p>

<a href="http://dopewars.sourceforge.net/">webpage</a>.</p>
