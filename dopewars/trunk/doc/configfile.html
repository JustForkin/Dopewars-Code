<h1>dopewars configuration files</h1>

A dopewars <a href="server.html">server</a>, or a <a href="clientplay.html">
client</a> (in single-player mode) can be heavily configured by the means
of dopewars configuration files. Clients used to connect to multiplayer
servers can also be configured by the same means, but almost all of these
settings will be overridden on connecting to the server (although the server
location settings <i>Port</i> and <i>Server</i> are still useful).<p>

The order of making dopewars settings is as follows:-
<ol>
<li>The global configuration file (if present) <b>/etc/dopewars</b>
<li>The user-specific file (if present) <b>~/.dopewars</b>
<li>Options specified on the <a href="commandline.html">command line</a>
</ol>

Settings in a configuration file can set numbers, strings or "string lists".
A numerical value is set with a command such as <b>Port=7902</b> (which sets
the TCP port for mulitplayer connections to 7902).<p>

String (text) values are set with commands such as <b>BankName="the bank"</b>
(which sets the name of the bank). Notice that string values <b>must</b> be
enclosed in quotes. Strings in double quotes understand escapes such as "\n";
strings in single quotes do not treat backslash characters specially.<p>

A string list is used for setting an array of strings; for example
<b>SubwaySaying = { "Saying 1", "Saying 2", "Saying 3" }</b> sets up three
"subway sayings". A string list consists of a list of strings, separated by
commas and wrapped with braces - { and } characters. Single strings in a
string list can be replaced individually - for example
<b>SubwaySaying[3]="Third Saying"</b> replaces the third string (which was
previously "Saying 3"). The <i>number</i> of strings in the list
<i>"List"</i> can be set with the variable <i>NumList</i> - for example,
<b>NumSubwaySaying=4</b> dimensions the <b>SubwaySaying</b> list to contain
four strings.<p>

Whitespace and line breaks are ignored in the configuration files; comments
can be used, and extend from a '#' character to the end of the current line,
or are enclosed by C-style /* and */ symbols. See the 
<a href="example-cfg">example configuration file</a> for a demonstration.
Valid configuration file settings are listed below. The examples given
generally reproduce the default behaviour; obviously you are free to replace
the parts in italics to customise your own server and client.<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#fileloc">General configuration: file and server locations</a>
<li><a href="#metaserver">Metaserver configuration</a>
<li><a href="#places">Basic configuration: places in the game</a>
<li><a href="#drugs">Basic configuration: drug prices</a>
<li><a href="#guns">Basic configuration: guns</a>
<li><a href="#advanced">Advanced configuration</a>
</ul>

<a name="fileloc"><h2>General configuration: file and server locations</h2></a>

<dl>
<a name="Port"><dt><b>Port=<i>7902</i></b></a>
<dd>Tells the dopewars client to look for a server on port <i>7902</i>, and
tells the dopewars server to bind to port <i>7902</i> and wait for connections.
This can be overridden with the -p <a href="commandline.html#port">
command line option</a>.

<a name="Server"><dt><b>Server=<i>"localhost"</i></b></a>
<dd>Tells the dopewars client to look for a server at the address
<i>localhost</i>. Dotted quad (e.g. 127.0.0.1) addresses may also be used here.
If this variable is set to one of the three "special" names
<b>(MetaServer)</b>, <b>(Prompt)</b>, or <b>(Single)</b> (including the 
brackets) then the client will not connect to a server but instead
list the servers available at the metaserver, prompt the user to enter a
server name and port, or play in single player mode, respectively.
This option can be overridden with the -o <a href="commandline.html#server">
command line option</a> (but be sure to protect the brackets from the shell
if you use one of the "special" names).

<a name="HiScoreFile"><dt><b>HiScoreFile=<i>"/var/lib/dopewars.sco"</i></b></a>
<dd>Tells the dopewars server (or the client, if running in single-player
mode, not connected to a server) to use the file <i>/var/lib/dopewars.sco</i>
to store high scores. This can be overridden with the -f
<a href="commandline.html#hiscore">command line option</a>.

<dt><b>Pager=<i>"more"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the pager used to display multi-page output in an interactive server
to <i>more</i>. ("less" is a popular alternative)

<dt><b>ConfigVerbose=<i>0</i></b>
<dd>Prints extra feedback information when processing the config. file if set
to 1; this only takes affect, of course, after the ConfigVerbose variable is
set, and then remains in force until it is reset again.
</dl>

<a name="metaserver"><h2>Metaserver configuration</h2></a>
<dl>
<a name="MetaServerActive"><dt><b>MetaServer.Active=<i>1</i></b></a>
<dd>Tells the dopewars server to report its status to the
<a href="metaserver.html">metaserver</a>. If <i>1</i>
is replaced by <i>0</i> (zero) the server will not report to the metaserver.
This setting, if set to 1, can be overridden by the -S
<a href="commandline.html#privateserver">command line option</a>.

<dt><b>MetaServer.Name=<i>"bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk"</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that the metaserver is located at
<i>bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk</i>. See the <a href="metaserver.html">metaserver</a>
page for information about connecting to the dopewars metaserver via. a
proxy web server.

<dt><b>MetaServer.HttpPort=<i>80</i></b>
<dd>Instructs the dopewars client that the metaserver can be found on TCP port
<i>80</i>. This is the standard HTTP port for Web access, but you may need to
change this if you are connecting via. a proxy web server.

<dt><b>MetaServer.UdpPort=<i>7802</i></b>
<dd>Instructs the dopewars server that the metaserver can be found on UDP port
<i>7802</i>. The server utilises UDP as oppposed to the TCP connection used
by the client due to its much lower overhead.

<dt><b>MetaServer.Path=<i>"/~ben/cgi-bin/server.pl"</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that the CGI script on the metaserver, for server
registration (server mode) or listing the available servers (client mode) is
<i>/~ben/cgi-bin/server.pl</i>.

<a name="MetaServerComment"><dt><b>MetaServer.Comment=<i>"dopewars
server"</i></b></a>
<dd>Sets the comment for your server, which appears on the list of servers
maintained by the metaserver, to <i>dopewars server</i>.

<dt><b>MetaServer.LocalName=<i>"dope-serv.com"</i></b></a>
<dd>Tells the metaserver that the preferred hostname of your dopewars server
machine is <i>dope-serv.com</i>. By default, the metaserver tries to ascertain
your domain name from the connection, and this can fail if you connect via.
a proxy server, or if DNS does not properly translate your IP address to your
domain name. You must also set MetaServer.Password to the password given to
you by the <a href="mailto:ben@bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk">metaserver
maintainer</a> for this to work. A blank LocalName can also be used with a
suitable password to identify "your" server, even if its IP changes.
See the <a href="metaserver.html">metaserver page</a> for more details.

<dt><b>MetaServer.Password=<i>"auth"</i></b></a>
<dd>Uses the password <i>auth</i> to authenticate your dopewars server's
hostname (see MetaServer.LocalName above) with the metaserver.
</dl>

<a name="places"><h2>Basic configuration: places in the game</h2></a>

<dl>
<dt><b>NumLocation=<i>8</i></b>

all!

<dt><b>Location[<i>4</i>].Name=<i>"Manhattan"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the name of the <i>4th</i> location in the game to <i>Manhattan</i>.
The index within the square brackets can range from 1 to whatever
NumLocation is set to above, or an error will be reported.

<dt><b>Location[<i>4</i>].PolicePresence=<i>90</i></b>
<dd>Sets the police presence in the <i>4th</i> location to <i>90%</i>. In

to players in location number <i>4</i> to <i>10</i>.

<dt><b>LoanShark=<i>1</i></b>
<dd>Makes the loan shark pop up when players visit location number <i>1</i>.

pay off debts) set this number to something which is not a valid location,
such as 0 (zero).

<dt><b>Bank=<i>1</i></b>
<dd>Makes the bank appear when a player visits location <i>1</i> (the Bronx).

<dd>Sets the usual maximum price of drug number <i>6</i> to be <i>$4,400</i>.

<dt><b>Drug[<i>1</i>].Cheap=<i>1</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that drug <i>1</i> (by default, Acid) can occasionally
be especially cheap (if this is set to 0, zero, this does not happen).

<dt><b>Drug[<i>1</i>].CheapStr=<i>"The market is flooded with cheap
home-made acid!"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the message to display to alert players that drug number <i>1</i>
is especially cheap.

<dt><b>Drugs.CheapDivide=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that whenever a drug is "specially" cheap, divide the 
normal price distribution (between Drug[x].MinPrice and Drug[x].MaxPrice) by
<i>4</i>.

<dt><b>Drug[<i>4</i>].Expensive=<i>1</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that drug <i>4</i> (normally Heroin) can occasionally be
particuarly expensive (0, zero, cancels this).

<dt><b>Drugs.ExpensiveStr1=<i>"Cops made a big %s bust! Prices are
outrageous!"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the string that is displayed when <b>any</b> drug is particularly
expensive. This is a standard C-style format string - i.e. the %s is
replaced by the name of the drug which is expensive. This string is
displayed 50% of the time for expensive drugs.

<dt><b>Drugs.ExpensiveStr2=<i>"Addicts are buying %s at ridiculous
prices!"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the string which is used for expensive drugs the other 50% of the 
time.

<dt><b>Drugs.ExpensiveMultiply=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that whenever a drug is "specially" expensive, multiply the

<i>4</i>.
</dl>

<a name="guns"><h2>Basic configuration: guns</h2></a>
<dl>
<dt><b>NumGun=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Configures the game to have <i>4</i> guns available to players at the
gun shop.

<dt><b>Gun[<i>3</i>].Name=<i>"Ruger"</i></b>

of the value set here.

<dt><b>Gun[<i>3</i>].Space=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that gun number <i>3</i> uses <i>4</i> spaces in the 
inventory - i.e. carrying one of these guns uses the same spaces as 4 drugs.

<dt><b>Gun[<i>3</i>].Damage=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Defines gun number <i>3</i> to do up to <i>4</i> points of damage - i.e.
a successful hit with one of these guns decreases the target's health by
up to 4 points.
</dl>

<a name="advanced"><h2>Advanced configuration</h2></a>
<dl>
<dt><b>NumTurns=<i>31</i></b>

to 0 (zero) the game never ends for a player, unless they quit or are killed.

<dt><b>Sanitized=<i>0</i></b>
<dd>If set to 1, this "sanitizes" the game by removing all drug references
from the random events. To completely remove drug references, of course, you
must also alter the drug names above.

<dt><b>DrugSortMethod=<i>1</i></b>
<dd>Tells the dopewars client how to sort the names of available drugs at
each location for display. The default, <i>1</i>, sorts them in alphabetical
order by their names. The choices are as follows:-

<li><b>2</b>. Sort in reverse alphabetical order by name
<li><b>3</b>. Sort in order of current price, cheapest first
<li><b>4</b>. Sort in order of current price, most expensive first
</ul>

<dt><b>FightTimeout=<i>5</i></b>
<dd>If a player in a firefight with another player fails to fire back
within <i>5</i> seconds, lets his/her enemy have another shot. If this
is set to 0 (zero) timeouts are disabled, and players may take as long
as they like to fire back.

<dt><b>IdleTimeout=<i>14400</i></b>
<dd>If a connected player in a game does nothing to interact with the
server for <i>14400</i> seconds, he/she will be automatically disconnected.

<dt><b>ConnectTimeout=<i>300</i></b>
<dd>If a player takes more than <i>300</i> seconds to complete the process

any one time.

<a name="AITurnPause"><dt><b>AITurnPause=<i>5</i></b></a>
<dd>Makes computer-controlled client players run from this machine (not

<i>$10,000</i>.

<dt><b>Bitch.MinPrice=<i>50000</i></b>

<dt><b>Bitch.MaxPrice=<i>150000</i></b>
<dd>Sets the maximum price for a bitch to <i>$150,000</i>.

says to you; one of <i>"First saying"</i>, <i>"Second saying"</i> and
<i>"Third saying"</i> will be displayed each time. Any previous sayings will
be erased. Note that individual sayings can be overwritten by appending an
array suffix to the variable name - for example, to replace
<i>"Third saying"</i> with <i>"3rd saying"</i> the following command would
suffice:-<br>
<b>SubwaySaying[3]="3rd saying"</b>

<dt><b>NumSubwaySaying=<i>5</i></b>
<dd>Sets there to be <i>5</i> distinct things that the lady on the subway
says to you. If this number is greater than the old number of sayings, the
