<h1>dopewars configuration files</h1>

<p>A dopewars <a href="server.html">server</a>, or a <a href="clientplay.html">
client</a> (in single-player mode) can be heavily configured by the means
of dopewars configuration files. Clients used to connect to multiplayer
servers can also be configured by the same means, but almost all of these
settings will be overridden on connecting to the server (although the server
location settings <i>Port</i> and <i>Server</i> are still useful).</p>

<p>The order of making dopewars settings is as follows:-</p>
<ol>
<li>The global configuration file (if present) <b>/etc/dopewars</b>
<li>The user-specific file (if present) <b>~/.dopewars</b>
<li><i>(Windows only)</i> The file <b>dopewars-config.txt</b> in the current
directory
<li>Options specified on the <a href="commandline.html">command line</a>
</ol>

<p>Settings in a configuration file can set numbers, booleans, strings or
"string lists". A numerical value is set with a command such as
<b>Port=7902</b> (which sets the TCP port for mulitplayer connections to
7902). Booleans are "on/off" or "true/false" variables, set with commands
such as <b>Sanitized=TRUE</b> (which removes drug references from random
events in the game).</p>

<p>String (text) values are set with commands such as <b>BankName='the bank'</b>
(which sets the name of the bank). Notice that string values <b>must</b> be
enclosed in quotes. Strings in double quotes understand escapes such as "\t";
strings in single quotes do not treat backslash characters specially, and
so should be used for Windows pathnames.</p>

<p>A string list is used for setting an array of strings; for example
<b>SubwaySaying = { "Saying 1", "Saying 2", "Saying 3" }</b> sets up three
"subway sayings". A string list consists of a list of strings, separated by
commas and wrapped with braces - { and } characters. Single strings in a
string list can be replaced individually - for example
<b>SubwaySaying[3]="Third Saying"</b> replaces the third string (which was
previously "Saying 3"). The <i>number</i> of strings in the list
<i>"List"</i> can be set with the variable <i>NumList</i> - for example,
<b>NumSubwaySaying=4</b> dimensions the <b>SubwaySaying</b> list to contain
four strings.</p>

<p>Whitespace and line breaks are ignored in the configuration files; comments
can be used, and extend from a '#' character to the end of the current line,
or are enclosed by C-style /* and */ symbols. See the 
<a href="example-cfg">example configuration file</a> for a demonstration.
Valid configuration file settings are listed below. The examples given
generally reproduce the default behaviour; obviously you are free to replace
the parts in italics to customise your own server and client.</p>

<h2><a name="fileloc">General configuration: file and server locations</a></h2>

<dl>
<dt><a name="Port"><b>Port=<i>7902</i></b></a>
<dd>Tells the dopewars client to look for a server on port <i>7902</i>, and
tells the dopewars server to bind to port <i>7902</i> and wait for connections.
This can be overridden with the -p <a href="commandline.html#port">
command line option</a>.

<dt><a name="Server"><b>Server=<i>"localhost"</i></b></a>
<dd>Tells the dopewars client to look for a server at the address
<i>localhost</i>. Dotted quad (e.g. 127.0.0.1) addresses may also be used here.
If this variable is set to one of the three "special" names
<b>(MetaServer)</b>, <b>(Prompt)</b>, or <b>(Single)</b> (including the 
brackets) then the client will not connect to a server but instead
list the servers available at the metaserver, prompt the user to enter a
server name and port, or play in single player mode, respectively.
This option can be overridden with the -o <a href="commandline.html#server">
command line option</a> (but be sure to protect the brackets from the shell
if you use one of the "special" names).

<dt><b>Socks.Active=<i>FALSE</i></b></a>
<dd>Instructs the dopewars client to connect directly to the given server,
without using an intermediate SOCKS server. If this is set to TRUE, all
connections go via. the SOCKS server. By default, SOCKS is not used for
metaserver communications - see the MetaServer.UseSocks variable. N.B. You
cannot run a dopewars server behind a SOCKS server, due to limitations in
the SOCKS protocol.

<dt><b>Socks.Name=<i>socks</i></b></a>
<dd>If using SOCKS, sets the hostname of the SOCKS server to connect to to
be <i>"socks"</i>.

<dt><b>Socks.Port=<i>1080</i></b></a>
<dd>Connects to the SOCKS server on TCP port <i>1080</i>.

<dt><b>Socks.Version=<i>4</i></b></a>
<dd>Uses SOCKS version <i>4</i>. Version 5 is also supported; SOCKS5 servers
support username/password authentication, unlike SOCKS4.

<dt><a name="HiScoreFile"><b>HiScoreFile=<i>"/var/lib/dopewars.sco"</i></b></a>
<dd>Tells the dopewars server (or the client, if running in single-player
mode, not connected to a server) to use the file <i>/var/lib/dopewars.sco</i>
to store high scores. This can be overridden with the -f
<a href="commandline.html#hiscore">command line option</a>.

<dt><b>Pager=<i>"more"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the pager used to display multi-page output in an interactive server
to <i>more</i>. ("less" is a popular alternative)

<dt><b>ConfigVerbose=<i>FALSE</i></b>
<dd>Prints extra feedback information when processing the config. file if set
to TRUE; this only takes affect, of course, after the ConfigVerbose variable is
set, and then remains in force until it is reset again.
</dl>

<h2><a name="metaserver">Metaserver configuration</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><a name="MetaServerActive"><b>MetaServer.Active=<i>TRUE</i></b></a>
<dd>Tells the dopewars server to report its status to the
<a href="metaserver.html">metaserver</a>. If <i>TRUE</i>
is replaced by <i>FALSE</i> the server will not report to the metaserver.
This setting, if set to TRUE, can be overridden by the -S
<a href="commandline.html#privateserver">command line option</a>.

<dt><b>MetaServer.Name=<i>"dopewars.sourceforge.net"</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that the metaserver is located at
<i>dopewars.sourceforge.net</i>. See the
<a href="metaserver.html">metaserver</a> page, and below, for information
about connecting to the dopewars metaserver via. a proxy web server.

<dt><b>MetaServer.Port=<i>80</i></b>
<dd>Instructs dopewarsclient that the metaserver can be found on TCP port
<i>80</i>. This is the standard HTTP port for Web access. (You shouldn't need
to change this, even if you connect via. a proxy.)

<dt><b>MetaServer.ProxyName=<i>"proxy.com"</i></b>
<dd>Sends all requests to the metaserver via. the web proxy at <i>proxy.com</i>.
If this is set to a blank string (the default) then the connection to the
metaserver is made directly.

<dt><b>MetaServer.ProxyPort=<i>8080</i></b>
<dd>Connects to the web proxy on port <i>8080</i>. (It then connects to the
metaserver on the port specified by MetaServer.Port.) This variable is ignored
if MetaServer.ProxyName is blank.

<dt><b>MetaServer.Path=<i>"/metaserver.php"</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that the PHP script on the metaserver, for server
registration (server mode) or listing the available servers (client mode) is
<i>/metaserver.php</i>.

<dt><a name="MetaServerComment"><b>MetaServer.Comment=<i>"dopewars
server"</i></b></a>
<dd>Sets the comment for your server, which appears on the list of servers
maintained by the metaserver, to <i>dopewars server</i>.

<dt><b>MetaServer.LocalName=<i>"dope-serv.com"</i></b>
<dd>Tells the metaserver that the preferred hostname of your dopewars server
machine is <i>dope-serv.com</i>. By default, the metaserver tries to ascertain
your domain name from the connection, and this can fail if you connect via.
a proxy server, or if DNS does not properly translate your IP address to your
domain name. You must also set MetaServer.Password to the password given to
you by the <a href="mailto:ben@bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk">metaserver
maintainer</a> for this to work. A blank LocalName can also be used with a
suitable password to identify "your" server, even if its IP changes.
See the <a href="metaserver.html">metaserver page</a> for more details.

<dt><b>MetaServer.Password=<i>"auth"</i></b>
<dd>Uses the password <i>auth</i> to authenticate your dopewars server's
hostname (see MetaServer.LocalName above) with the metaserver.

<dt><b>MetaServer.UseSocks=<i>FALSE</i></b>
<dd>Even if "Socks.Active" is TRUE, do not use SOCKS for metaserver
communication - connect directly to the metaserver or proxy.

</dl>

<h2><a name="places">Basic configuration: places in the game</a></h2>

<dl>

to players in location number <i>4</i> to <i>10</i>.

<dt><b>LoanShark=<i>1</i></b>
<dd>Makes the loan shark pop up when players visit location number <i>1</i>.
To stop the loan shark from appearing at all (making it rather difficult to
pay off debts) set this number to something which is not a valid location,
such as 0 (zero).

<dt><b>Bank=<i>1</i></b>
<dd>Makes the bank appear when a player visits location <i>1</i> (the Bronx).

<dt><b>Drug[<i>6</i>].MinPrice=<i>1500</i></b>
<dd>Sets the usual minimum price of the <i>6th</i> drug (in the absence of
"special events" such as drug busts) to be <i>$1,500</i>.

<dt><b>Drug[<i>6</i>].MaxPrice=<i>4400</i></b>
<dd>Sets the usual maximum price of drug number <i>6</i> to be <i>$4,400</i>.

<dt><b>Drug[<i>1</i>].Cheap=<i>TRUE</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that drug <i>1</i> (by default, Acid) can occasionally
be especially cheap (if this is set to FALSE, this does not happen).

<dt><b>Drug[<i>1</i>].CheapStr=<i>"The market is flooded with cheap
home-made acid!"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the message to display to alert players that drug number <i>1</i>
is especially cheap.

<dt><b>Drugs.CheapDivide=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that whenever a drug is "specially" cheap, divide the 
normal price distribution (between Drug[x].MinPrice and Drug[x].MaxPrice) by
<i>4</i>.

<dt><b>Drug[<i>4</i>].Expensive=<i>TRUE</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that drug <i>4</i> (normally Heroin) can occasionally be
particuarly expensive (FALSE cancels this).

<dt><b>Drugs.ExpensiveStr1=<i>"Cops made a big %tde bust! Prices are
outrageous!"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the string that is displayed when <b>any</b> drug is particularly
expensive. This is similar to a standard C-style format string - i.e. the
%tde is replaced by the name of the drug which is expensive. (See the
<a href="i18n.html">Internationalization page</a> for further information
on this notation.) This string is displayed 50% of the time for expensive drugs.

<dt><b>Drugs.ExpensiveStr2=<i>"Addicts are buying %tde at ridiculous
prices!"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the string which is used for expensive drugs the other 50% of the 
time.

<dt><b>Drugs.ExpensiveMultiply=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that whenever a drug is "specially" expensive, multiply the
normal price distribution (between Drug[x].MinPrice and Drug[x].MaxPrice) by
<i>4</i>.
</dl>

<h2><a name="combat">Basic configuration: guns and fighting</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>NumGun=<i>4</i></b>

Guns offered "on the street" (i.e. by random events) will be priced at 10%
of the value set here.

<dt><b>Gun[<i>3</i>].Space=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Tells dopewars that gun number <i>3</i> uses <i>4</i> spaces in the 
inventory - i.e. carrying one of these guns uses the same spaces as 4 drugs.

<dt><b>Gun[<i>3</i>].Damage=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Defines gun number <i>3</i> to do up to <i>4</i> points of damage.

<dt><b>PlayerArmour=<i>100</i></b>
<dd>Sets the percentage armour rating of each player to <i>100</i> - this
defines the amount of health that you lose when you are successfully hit.
If 100, you lose the same number of health points as the gun's damage.
If more than 100, you lose fewer health points, and if less than 100, you lose
<b>more</b> health points than the gun's damage. This rating applies only
when you have no bitches.

<dt><b>BitchArmour=<i>50</i></b>
<dd>Sets the percentage armour rating of each bitch to <i>50</i>.

<dt><b>NumCop=<i>3</i></b>

<dd>Sets the armour rating of the first cop's deputies to <i>3%</i>.

<dt><b>Cop[<i>1</i>].AttackPenalty=<i>30</i></b>
<dd>When attacking another player, whether you successfully hit them depends
on whether your attack rating is greater than their defence rating, which are
generally numbers between 0 and 100 (think of them as percentages). This
penalises the first cop (and his deputies) by <i>30%</i> when attacking you.

<dt><b>Cop[<i>1</i>].DefendPenalty=<i>30</i></b>
<dd>Penalises the first cop (and his deputies) by <i>30%</i> when defending

<h2><a name="advanced">Advanced configuration</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>LogLevel=<i>2</i></b>

to 5 (most verbose). This setting instructs the server only to log messages
from level 0 up to <i>2</i>, inclusive.

<dt><b>LogTimestamp=<i>"[%H:%M:%S] "</i></b>
<dd>Prefixes all log messages with a timestamp of the form (e.g.)
<i>[16:34:49]</i>. This is a string which is passed as input to the
<tt>strftime(3)</tt> function. If this is set to a blank string, then no
timestamp is added to log messages.

<dt><b>NumTurns=<i>31</i></b>
<dd>Defines the game to end after <i>31</i> "days" or turns. If this is set
to 0 (zero) the game never ends for a player, unless they quit or are killed.

<dt><b>Sanitized=<i>FALSE</i></b>
<dd>If set to TRUE, this "sanitizes" the game by removing all drug references
from the random events. To completely remove drug references, of course, you
must also alter the drug names above.

<dt><b>DrugSortMethod=<i>1</i></b>
<dd>Tells the dopewars client how to sort the names of available drugs at
each location for display. The default, <i>1</i>, sorts them in alphabetical
order by their names. The choices are as follows:-
<ul>

<li><b>2</b>. Sort in reverse alphabetical order by name
<li><b>3</b>. Sort in order of current price, cheapest first
<li><b>4</b>. Sort in order of current price, most expensive first
</ul>

<dt><b>FightTimeout=<i>5</i></b>
<dd>If a player in a firefight with another player fails to fire back
within <i>5</i> seconds, lets his/her enemy have another shot. If this
is set to 0 (zero) timeouts are disabled, and players may take as long
as they like to fire back.

<dt><b>IdleTimeout=<i>14400</i></b>
<dd>If a connected player in a game does nothing to interact with the
server for <i>14400</i> seconds, he/she will be automatically disconnected.

<dt><b>ConnectTimeout=<i>300</i></b>
<dd>If a player takes more than <i>300</i> seconds to complete the process
of connecting or disconnecting to the server, the server will sever the
connection.

<dt><a name="MaxClients"><b>MaxClients=<i>20</i></b></a>
<dd>Prevents more than <i>20</i> clients from connecting to the server at
any one time.

<dt><a name="AITurnPause"><b>AITurnPause=<i>5</i></b></a>
<dd>Makes computer-controlled client players run from this machine (not
necessarily AI players that connect to a server run on this machine) wait
<i>5</i> seconds between moving from location to location - i.e. a turn
takes at least 5 seconds.

<dt><b>StartCash=<i>2000</i></b>
<dd>Each player will start the game with <i>$2,000</i> in cash.

<dt><b>StartDebt=<i>5000</i></b>
<dd>Each player will start the game with a debt to the loan shark of
<i>$5,000</i>.

<dt><b>Names.Bitch=<i>"bitch"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the word used to describe a single "bitch" in the game. Bitch, gun
and drug names are automatically capitalised where necessary by the dopewars
code.

<dt><b>Names.Bitches=<i>"bitches"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the word used to describe two or more "bitches".

<dt><b>Names.Gun=<i>"gun"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the word used to describe a single "gun" (for example, it could be
replaced by "knife").

<dt><b>Names.Guns=<i>"guns"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the word used to describe two or more "guns".

<dt><b>Names.Drug=<i>"drug"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the word used to describe a single "drug" (for example, it could be
replaced by "candy bar" or something similarly innocuous).

<dt><b>Names.Drugs=<i>"drugs"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the word used to describe two or more "drugs".

<dt><b>Names.Month=<i>"12-"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the text which is displayed on the client's screen to the immediate
left of the current turn (by default, a "turn" is a day, and so this part
is the month, in displaying the date in MM-DD-YYYY format)

<dt><b>Names.Year=<i>"-1984"</i></b>
<dd>Sets the text displayed to the immediate right of the current turn (by
default, the year).

<dt><b>Prices.Spy=<i>20000</i></b>
<dd>Sets the price to pay a bitch to spy on another player to be
<i>$20,000</i>.

<dt><b>Prices.Tipoff=<i>10000</i></b>
<dd>Sets the price to pay a bitch to tip off the cops to another player to be
<i>$10,000</i>.

<dt><b>Bitch.MinPrice=<i>50000</i></b>
<dd>Sets the minimum price for a bitch at the Rough Pub to be <i>$50,000</i>.
Note that prices for bitches "on the street" (i.e. those that are offered
by random events) are produced by dividing the normal bitch price
distribution by 10.

<dt><b>Bitch.MaxPrice=<i>150000</i></b>
<dd>Sets the maximum price for a bitch to <i>$150,000</i>.

<dt><b>SubwaySaying= <i>{ "First saying", "Second saying",
"Third saying" }</i></b>
<dd>Sets the list of things which the lady you sometimes meet on the subway 
says to you; one of <i>"First saying"</i>, <i>"Second saying"</i> and
<i>"Third saying"</i> will be displayed each time. Any previous sayings will
be erased. Note that individual sayings can be overwritten by appending an
array suffix to the variable name - for example, to replace
<i>"Third saying"</i> with <i>"3rd saying"</i> the following command would
suffice:-<br>
<b>SubwaySaying[3]="3rd saying"</b>

<dt><b>NumSubwaySaying=<i>5</i></b>
<dd>Sets there to be <i>5</i> distinct things that the lady on the subway
says to you. If this number is greater than the old number of sayings, the
newly added sayings will be blank; if it is smaller, the sayings that are now
beyond the end of the list will be deleted.

<dt><b>Playing= <i>{ "Song 1", "Song 2", "Song 3" }</i></b>
<dd>Sets the list of things which you can sometimes hear playing while
jetting; one of <i>"Song 1"</i>, <i>"Song 2"</i> or <i>"Song 3"</i> will be
displayed. See the help for <b>SubwaySaying</b> for more details.

<dt><b>NumPlaying=<i>4</i></b>
<dd>Sets there to be <i>4</i> distinct things which you can sometimes hear
playing.

<dt><b>StoppedTo= <i>{ "have a beer", "smoke a joint", "smoke a cigar",
"smoke a Djarum", "smoke a cigarette" }</i></b>
<dd>Sets the list of things which you sometimes stop to do while jetting;
see <b>SubwaySaying</b> for more details.

<dt><b>NumStoppedTo=<i>5</i></b>
<dd>Sets there to be <i>5</i> distinct things which you can stop to do.

<dt><b>DrugValue=<i>TRUE</i></b>
<dd>If TRUE, then the server will keep track of the price you paid for
any drugs, and clients will display this information if available.
