<h1>Interactive server commands</h1>

Available commands are listed below. Please note also that any valid
line from a <a href="configfile.html">configuration file</a> can
be entered at the interactive server's prompt. Note, however, that game
options cannot be changed while players are connected. In addition, the
current value of any option from the configuration files can be displayed
by typing the name of the variable by itself. For example, entering 
<i>MetaServer.Comment</i> at the prompt will display the comment that the
server sends to the <a href="metaserver.html">metaserver</a>.

<dl>
<dt><b>help</b>
<dd>Displays a help screen, listing valid server commands and the variables
which can be set in <a href="configfile.html">configuration files</a>.

<dt><b>list</b>
<dd>Lists the given names of all the players currently logged on to the
server.

<dt><b>push <i>Bert</i></b>
<dd>Politely asks the player with the given name <i>Bert</i> to leave the
server - i.e. sends a message to the client, which should then finish off
and break the connection at the far end.

<dt><b>kill <i>Bert</i></b>
<dd>Abruptly breaks the connection to the player with given name <i>Bert</i>.
This is necessary if, for example, the client refuses to acknowledge a
"push" message.

<dt><b>msg:<i>Hi all!</i></b>
<dd>Broadcasts the message <i>Hi all!</i> to all players currently connected
to this server.

<dt><b>quit</b>
<dd>Politely quit, by asking all clients to leave, and then terminating once
they have done so. An "impolite" quit, which is necessary if the clients fail
to respond to this message, is performed on receipt of a SIGINT or SIGTERM
signal (i.e. pressing Ctrl-C or killing the process with the "kill" command).
