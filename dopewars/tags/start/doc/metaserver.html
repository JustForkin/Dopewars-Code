<h1>The dopewars metaserver</h1>

Every dopewars <a href="server.html">server</a> is different, due to their
differing locations and configurations. Thus some centralised system for
listing the currently available servers and displaying some sort of comment
about the games running on them is necessary, to enable client players to
pick the game that most suits them. This is the function of the dopewars
<b>metaserver</b>.<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#location">Metaserver location</a>
<li><a href="#client">Using the metaserver from the client</a>
<li><a href="#server">Using the metaserver from the server</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="#wrongip">But it's displaying the wrong IP address!</a>
<li><a href="#dynamicip">But my server has a dynamic IP...</a>
</ul>
</ul>

<a name="location"><h2>Metaserver location</h2></a>
The metaserver has a CGI (web) interface for humans and dopewars clients to 
read from, and a UDP interface for servers to report to. It lives at the
same place as the <a href="http://bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~ben/dopewars/">
main dopewars page</a>; the CGI interface listens on TCP port 80, and the
UDP interface on port 7802. These are the default settings which all
dopewars servers and clients use for metaserver communication.<p>

<a name="client"><h2>Using the metaserver from the client</h2></a>
Players who want to use the metaserver to list the currently available
servers should go to
<a href="http://bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~ben/cgi-bin/serverlist.pl">this
link</a>, or just follow the "Servers" link from the main dopewars web page.
It cannot be guaranteed that all the listed servers are functional - they
may, for example, have been registered in error, or a server may have crashed
since being added to the list - but the list is checked daily for service,
and so there is at least a good chance that the servers listed there will
be working.<p>

The metaserver, being a collection of CGI scripts, should work happily on
most machines which have web access. A problem occurs, however, if your
connection to the Web is via. an enforced proxy server (i.e. traffic on
port 80 from your machine is blocked by firewall). dopewars can be
configured to connect via. a proxy server without too much difficulty; if
your proxy server is at <i>proxy.com</i> on port <i>8080</i> then you should
add the following lines to your dopewars <a href="configfile.html">
configuration file</a>:-<br>
<b>MetaServer.Name=proxy.com<br>
MetaServer.Port=8080<br>
MetaServer.Path=http://bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~ben/cgi-bin/server.pl</b><p>

<a name="server"><h2>Using the metaserver from the server</h2></a>
People running servers who <b>do not</b> want their details listed by the
metaserver should disable the metaserver comunication of the server with
the <a href="configfile.html#MetaServerActive">MetaServer.Active=0</a>
configuration file setting, or the <b>-S</b>
<a href="commandline.html#privateserver">command line option</a>. Servers
which <b>do</b> register their details can have their accompanying comment
set with the <a href="configfile.html#MetaServerComment">
MetaServer.Comment</a> configuration file setting.<p>

Each dopewars server notifies the metaserver of its current status, and
sends this data on startup and shutdown, and when players leave or join the
game. See the <a href="server.html">server page</a> for more details.<p>

<a name="wrongip"><h3>But it's displaying the wrong IP address!</h3></a>
Once connected to the metaserver, you may find that it incorrectly
displays the domain name of your server machine. This is usually because the
metaserver cannot resolve your IP address to a domain name.<p>

In this case, you will need to override the hostname that the metaserver
guesses for your machine with one you choose yourself. This is done by
specifying the hostname with the MetaServer.LocalName variable in your dopewars
<a href="configfile.html">configuration file</a>. In order to prevent abuse
of this facility, you must obtain a password from the metaserver maintainer to
authenticate your chosen hostname.
<a href="mailto:ben@bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk">Email</a> the maintainer, giving
the exact hostname you want to use (be aware that this is case-sensitive) and
you will be given a password. Specify this password with the MetaServer.Password
variable in the dopewars configuration file.<p>

For example, if you wish your server to be known as <b>dope-serv.com</b> and
you have emailed the maintainer, receiving the password <b>Dope-Auth</b>, then
add the following to the dopewars configuration file:-<br>
<b>MetaServer.LocalName=dope-serv.com<br>
MetaServer.Password=Dope-Auth</b><p>

Restart your dopewars server, or send it a SIGUSR1 signal, for the change to
take effect. Bear in mind that if you make up a non-existent or invalid domain
name, the metaserver will accept it, but the server will be removed from the
metaserver's list when it is checked daily for service.<p>

<a name="dynamicip"><h3>But my server has a dynamic IP...</h3></a>
Finally, your server's IP may be resolved happily, but you may have a connection
to the internet which assigns you a dynamic IP. Consider what happens if your
connection is broken before the dopewars server exits; the metaserver will
list the IP of the "old" server, and you will now have no way of removing that
entry when your connection comes back up, as your IP will be different. In
this case, you can <a href="mailto:ben@bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk">email</a> the
metaserver maintainer, and specify a blank MetaServer.LocalName variable.
You will again receive a MetaServer.Password variable (see 
<a href="#wrongip">above</a>), which the metaserver
will use to identify "your" server; now, when your internet connection is
restored, the server registration with the "new" IP will automatically replace
the "old" one.
