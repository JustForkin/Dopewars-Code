<h1>dopewars and Microsoft Windows</h1>

dopewars now runs natively on Win32 systems (95, 98, NT). It runs as a console
application, so if you want a pretty pointy-clicky dopewars client, you'll have
to write your own - but feel free to
<a href="mailto:ben@bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk">email me</a> if you want to tackle
such a project!<p>

Binaries can be obtained from the main
<a href="http://bellatrix.pcl.ox.ac.uk/~ben/dopewars/download.html">download
site</a>, or dopewars will compile with the free
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a> tools under Win32.
The installation procedure is the same as <a href="installation.html">that for
Unix systems</a> - download the tarball, extract the files, change into the
created directory, run the <b>configure</b> script, and then <b>make</b>. This
builds a native Win32 binary, which does not need the Cygwin libraries to
run.<p>

In virtually all respects, the Unix and Win32 versions of dopewars should be
identical. Both will accept the same command line parameters and configuration
options. Be aware that unless you change the directories with configure before
you build, however, the Win32 port will attempt to locate the high score file
in its standard Unix location, which will almost certainly fail to be found on a
Windows machine. The dopewars configuration file will still be read from
$HOME/.dopewars or /etc/dopewars, so one can still be used under Windows by
creating a file "C:\etc\dopewars" (or similar - but take care that Windows
doesn't helpfully add a ".txt" extension to it for you; create it from a DOS
prompt to be sure) or by setting the environment variable HOME to a sensible
directory and placing a configuration file ".dopewars" within that directory.<p>
